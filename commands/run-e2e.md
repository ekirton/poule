You are executing the `/run-e2e` command. This command runs end-to-end tests by executing user prompts from `test/e2e/test_*.md` files against the Poule MCP tools, recording results in `test/e2e/results.md`, and updating `examples/README.md` to list only passing prompts.

## Determine scope

The user may provide a scope argument after `/run-e2e`:
- A specific test file name or pattern (e.g., `test_navigation.md`, `navigation`): run only that test file.
- No argument: run all `test/e2e/test_*.md` files.

Use `Glob` with the pattern `test/e2e/test_*.md` to collect the list of test files.

## Run tests

For each test file in scope, read the file and extract every prompt (text inside ``` fenced code blocks).

For each prompt:

1. **Skip slash commands.** If the prompt starts with `/` (e.g., `/explain-error`, `/formalize`), record it as **SKIP** with reason "Slash command — tested separately".

2. **Execute the prompt.** Call the appropriate Poule MCP tools as a user would. Use your judgment to select tools — the prompt text describes what the user wants, not which tool to call. For prompts that require a proof session, open one, execute the steps, then close it when done.

3. **Evaluate the result:**
   - **PASS** — tool returned relevant, non-empty results that answer the question.
   - **FAIL** — tool returned an error, empty results, or clearly unrelated results.

4. **Record a one-line reason** summarizing what happened: which tool was called, what it returned, and why it passes or fails. Be specific — name the tool, mention result counts, cite key identifiers found.

## Update results.md

Read `test/e2e/results.md` to understand its current structure.

For each section, update or create the results table with columns: `#`, `Prompt`, `Result`, `Reason`.

Number prompts sequentially within each section (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, ... for Discovery and Search; 2.1, 2.2, ... for Errors).

After updating individual results:

1. **Update the summary table** at the top with per-section PASS/FAIL/SKIP counts.
2. **Update the total line** (e.g., "60 PASS, 19 FAIL, 10 SKIP (89 total)").
3. **Update the "Tested:" line** with today's date and the extent of the retest (e.g., "full retest of all prompts" or "retested navigation and debugging sections only").
4. **Update the "Remaining Issues" section:**
   - Delete issues that are now resolved (all referenced tests pass).
   - Add new issues for any new FAIL results, with sufficient detail to investigate.
   - Do not mark issues as "FIXED" — simply delete resolved ones.

## Update examples/README.md

Read `examples/README.md` to understand its current structure.

Synchronize it with the test results:
- **Add** passing prompts that are missing from `examples/README.md`, placing them under the appropriate section and subsection heading.
- **Remove** failing prompts that are currently listed in `examples/README.md`.
- Do not modify slash command prompts in `examples/README.md` (they are included regardless of SKIP status).
- Preserve the existing section structure, introductory text, and subsection headings.

## Example data

Example Coq files in `examples/` provide project context for prompts that reference specific files: `algebra.v` (my_lemma, ring_morph, axiom comparisons), `typeclasses.v` (Proper instances, setoid rewriting, typeclass resolution), `dependent.v` (convoy pattern, dependent types), `automation.v` (auto vs eauto, hint databases, custom Ltac), `flocq.v` (bpow/simpl debugging).

## Cleanup

Close all open proof sessions before finishing. Use `list_proof_sessions` to check, then `close_proof_session` for each.

## Output

When done, print a summary:
- Date and scope of the test run
- Total PASS / FAIL / SKIP counts
- List of any newly failing prompts (regressions)
- List of any newly passing prompts (fixes)
- Confirmation that `results.md` and `examples/README.md` have been updated
